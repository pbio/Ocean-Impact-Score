# Ocean Impact Score

## This is a simple app to organise and visualise the Ocean Impact Scores from [Waves of Change](https://www.wavesofchange.earth/). 

### Each public company in this list is assigned a score based on a deep learning model trained on academic papers and reliable articles about the company's environmental impact. In future versions of this tool the score updates will happen in real time. 

### It was built with Next.js and Material.ui

### It is not yet connected to the backend, but this is on our to do list!

### Please contact the [Waves of Change Team](team@wavesofchange.earth) if you have any questions.
